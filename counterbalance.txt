24 practice trials and 60 test trials

30 properties for True trials

each target property pair (skunk - smelly) appears twice in T and twice in F
	if in T, then in 'related' and 'unrelated' NOT in control
	
	
	

			Subject		Predicate

1 = closely related to property, 0 = unrelated to property

which features are most diagnostic? depends on other categories learned - but also should depend on context!

is the effect additive or multiplicative (additive is uninteresting) - e.g. flowers ... skunk - smelly   vs  tree ... skunk - smelly
